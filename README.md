# Calculator-Using-HTML-CSS-AND-JAVASCRIPT

This is a simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator has a clean and modern user interface, with buttons for the digits, basic arithmetic operations, and a clear button to reset the display.

The calculator uses JavaScript to perform the calculations and update the display. It can handle basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,division and Modulo , as well as decimal numbers and negative values.

The calculator is designed to be responsive, so it looks and works great. The layout adjusts to the available screen size, and the buttons are easy to tap on touch screens.

This project demonstrates my ability to create a functional and visually appealing web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
